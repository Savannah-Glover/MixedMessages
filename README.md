# MixedMessages

This project generates random messages which are displayed in a card on the webpage. The messages can be advice, inspirational, or ASCII art, depending on what the user chooses from a dropdown menu.

## How it Works

The generator has three types of messages it can generate: 

1. **Advice messages**: These are generated from two arrays of strings, one with the start of the advice, and one with the end. A message is formed by randomly choosing a string from each array.

2. **Inspirational messages**: These work the same way as advice messages, but the messages are generated from three strings of arrays, one with the start, middle, and the end.

3. **ASCII art**: These messages are generated from an array of strings, each containing a different piece of ASCII art.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Choose the type of message you want from the dropdown menu.
3. The generated message will appear in the card on the webpage.
